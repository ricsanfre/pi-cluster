## Loki architecture

Loki architecture is displayed in the following picture (source: [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/fundamentals/architecture/components)):

![LOKI-Architecture-Components](/assets/img/loki_architecture_components.svg)

All Loki components are included within a single binary (docker image) that  supports three different deployments modes where the above components can be started in different PODs 

- Monolithic

  In this mode, all Loki components are running in a single process (container).

- Simple scalable mode

  In this deployment, Loki is deployed in HA, deploying replicas of write and read nodes (processes)
  - Write nodes: supporting write path. *Distributor* and *Ingestor* components, responsible to store logs and indexes in the back-end storage (Minio S3 storage)
  - Read nodes: supporting read path. *Ruler*, *Querier* and *Frontend Querier* components, responsible to answer to log queries.
  - Backend nodes: loki backend services *Compactor*, *Index gateways* and *Query scheduler â€“ Ruler*
  - Gateway node: a load balancer in front of Loki (nginx based), which directs `/loki/api/v1/push` traffic to the write nodes. All other requests go to the read nodes. Traffic should be sent in a round robin fashion.

- Microservices
  In this deployment each individual Loki component can be started in an independent process (container).
  

Further details in Loki architecture documentation: [Loki components](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/fundamentals/architecture/components/) and [deployment modes](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/fundamentals/architecture/deployment-modes/)

Loki will be installed using Simple scalable deployment mode using as S3 Object Storage Server (Minio) as backend.


![K3S-LOKI-Architecture](/assets/img/loki-architecture.png)

## Configure S3 Minio Server

Minio Storage server is used as Loki long-term data storage. 

Grafana Loki needs to store two different types of data: chunks and indexes. Both of them can be stored in S3 server.

{{site.data.alerts.note}}

Loki helm chart is able to install this Minio service as a subchart, but its installation will be disabled and Minio Storage Service already deployed in the cluster will be used as Loki's backend. 

As part of Minio Storage Service installation, loki's S3 bucket, policy and user is already configured.
See documentation: [Minio S3 Object Storage Service](/docs/minio/).

{{site.data.alerts.end}}

### Create Minio user and bucket

Use Minio's `mc` command to create loki bucket and user

```shell
mc mb <minio_alias>/k3s-loki 
mc admin user add <minio_alias> loki <user_password>
```
{{site.data.alerts.note}}

As the Loki's documentation said, when using S3 as object storage, the following permissions are needed:

- s3:ListBucket
- s3:PutObject
- s3:GetObject
- s3:DeleteObject (if running the Single Store (boltdb-shipper) compactor)

Over the resources: arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>, arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>/*

{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Apply policy to user `loki` so it has the proper persmissions on `k3s-loki` bucket.

```shell
  mc admin policy add <minio_alias> loki user_policy.json
```

Where `user_policy.json`, contains the following AWS access policies definition:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "s3:DeleteObject",
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:ListBucket",
            "s3:PutObject"
        ],
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::k3s-loki",
            "arn:aws:s3:::k3s-loki/*"
        ]
    }  
  ]
}
``` 

See further details in [Loki-Storage documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/operations/storage/)

## Loki installation

Installation from helm chart. There are two alternatives:

- [Loki-stack helm chart](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/loki-stack). With this helm chart the complete PLG stack can be installed.
  
  This helm chart will not be used because we are only interested in deploying Loki component. Promtail will not be used and Grafana will be deployed as part of kube-prometheus-stack.

- [Loki-helm chart v3.x](https://github.com/grafana/loki/tree/main/production/helm/loki). Used for [Monolithic](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/fundamentals/architecture/deployment-modes/#monolithic-mode) and Simple scalable deployment modes](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/fundamentals/architecture/deployment-modes/#simple-scalable-deployment-mode).

  This is the helm chart we will use to deploy Loki in HA (simple scalable deployment mode).

- Step 1: Add the Grafana repository:
  ```shell
  helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
  ```
- Step2: Fetch the latest charts from the repository:
  ```shell
  helm repo update
  ```
- Step 3: Create namespace
  ```shell
  kubectl create namespace loki
  ```
- Step 4: Create file `loki-values.yml`

  ```yml
  # Setting simple scalable deployment mode
  deploymentMode: SimpleScalable

  loki:
    # Disable multi-tenant support
    auth_enabled: false

    # S3 backend storage configuration
    storage:
      bucketNames:
        chunks: <minio_loki_bucket>
        ruler: <minio_loki_bucket>
      type: s3
      s3:
        endpoint: <minio_endpoint>
        region: <minio_site_region>
        secretAccessKey: <minio_loki_key>
        accessKeyId: <minio_loki_user>
        s3ForcePathStyle: true
        insecure: false
        http_config:
          idle_conn_timeout: 90s
          response_header_timeout: 0s
          insecure_skip_verify: false
    # Storage Schema
    schemaConfig:
      configs:

          prefix: loki_index_
          period: 24h
        object_store: s3
        schema: v13

  # Configuration for the write

    # Number of replicas for the write
    replicas: 3
    persistence:
      # -- Size of persistent disk
      size: 10Gi
      # -- Storage class to be used.
      storageClass: longhorn

  # Configuration for the read
  read:
    # Number of replicas for the read
    replicas: 3
    persistence:
      # -- Size of persistent disk
      size: 10Gi
      # -- Storage class to be used.
      storageClass: longhorn

  # Configuration for the backend

    # -- Number of replicas for the gateway
    replicas: 1

  # Disable mino installation
  minio:
    enabled: false

  # Disable self-monitoring
  monitoring:
    selfMonitoring:
      enabled: false
      grafanaAgent:
        installOperator: false
      lokiCanary:
          enabled: false

  # Disable helm-test
  test:
    enabled: false
  ```

  This configuration:

  - Set simple scalable deployment mode (`deploymentMode: SimpleScalable`)

  - Disable multi-tenant support (`auth_enabled: false`) so it is not needed to provide org_id in HTTP headers.

  - Enable S3 as storage backend, providing Minio credentials and bucket. (`loki.storage`).

  - Configure TSDB as storage schema (`loki.schemaConfig`). See [Loki Storage Schema doc](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/operations/storage/schema/) and [TSDB Storage](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/operations/storage/tsdb/)

  - Configure three replicas for write (`write`), read (`read`) and backend (`backend`)components and persistent volumes using Longhorn

  - Enable one replica for gateway component (`gateway`)

  - Disable minio server installation (`minio.enabled`)

  - Disable self-monitoring (`monitoring.selfmonitoring`) and helm-test validation (`test.enabled`)

- Step 5: Install Loki in `loki` namespace
  ```shell
  helm install loki grafana/loki -f loki-values.yml --namespace loki
  ```
- Step 6: Check status of Loki pods
  ```shell
  kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=loki -n loki
  ```

### GitOps installation

As an alternative, for GitOps deployments, instead of hardcoding minio credentials within Helm chart values, a external secret can be configured leveraging [Loki's capability of using environment variables in config file](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/configuration/#use-environment-variables-in-the-configuration).


The following secret need to be created:
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: loki-minio-secret
  namespace: loki
type: Opaque
data:
  MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID: < minio_loki_user | b64encode >
  MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: < minio_loki_key | b64encode >
```

And the following Helm values has to be provided:

```yml
loki:
  # Disable multi-tenant support
  auth_enabled: false

  # S3 backend storage configuration
  storage:
    bucketNames:
      chunks: k3s-loki
      ruler: k3s-loki
    type: s3
    s3:
      endpoint: s3.picluster.ricsanfre.com:9091
      region: eu-west-1
      secretAccessKey: ${MINIO_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
      accessKeyId: ${MINIO_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
      s3ForcePathStyle: true
      insecure: false
      http_config:
        idle_conn_timeout: 90s
        response_header_timeout: 0s
        insecure_skip_verify: false

## Grafana Configuration

Loki need to be added to Grafana as DataSource

This can be done automatically when installing kube-prometheus-stack providing the following additional helm chart configuration:

```yml
grafana:
  # Additional data source
  additionalDataSources:
  - name: Loki
    type: loki
    url: http://loki-read-headless.loki.svc.cluster.local
```
