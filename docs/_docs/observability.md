The observability/monitoring solution for Raspberry Pi cluster is the following:

![observability-architecture](/assets/img/observability-architecture.png)

This solution allow to monitor application traces, logs and metrics providing a single pane of glass where all information from an application can be showed in dashboards.

Monitoring solution is based on the following components:
- [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) (logging)
- [Grafana Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/) (distributed tracing)
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) (monitoring)
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) (single pane of glass)

Logging solution is complemented with a log analytics solution based on Elasticsearch and Kibana.

Common log collection and distrution layer, implemented with fluentbit/fluentd, feeds logs to Log Analytics platform (ES) and Log Monitoring platform (Loki).
