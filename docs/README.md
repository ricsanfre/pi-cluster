jekyll 3.9.0 | Error:  no implicit conversion of Hash into Integer
/home/user/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.0.0/gems/pathutil-0.16.2/lib/pathutil.rb:502:in `read': no implicit conversion of Hash into Integer (TypeError)
        from /home/user/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.0.0/gems/pathutil-0.16.2/lib/pathutil.rb:502:in `read'
```

Jekyll 3.9 isnâ€™t compatible with Ruby 3 so a patch need to be applied to pathutil.rb
